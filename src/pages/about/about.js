                Thank you for taking the time to check out my personal website! i made this with react.js
                and some good old typical css. i am a recent computer science graduate who also holds an associate
                degree in general studies.

                From an early age, i was introduced to the world of computer gaming and that sparked it all.
                as i grew up playing video games, i started to tinker with the various components of my pc to
                get more fps and maximize my computer's performance. i started to learn about overclocking,
                undervolting, and even messing with the windows registry to remove unnecessary windows bloat. one
                thing led to another, and eventually, i graduated high school with no idea what i wanted to do
                in life.. but what 18-year-old does yano?

                i went to my local community college and worked on my associate's degree while taking various
                electives to hone in on what i wanted. i landed in computer science; from there, the rest is history.
                i have now received my bachelor's degree and am looking to find my first professional software
                engineering role where i can make a difference by pursuing my passion for impactful technology.
