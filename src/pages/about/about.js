                My interest in computers started with gaming, which led me to tinker with my PC to boost performance.
                From overclocking my gpu to tweaking the Windows registry, I dove into the tech world early on. After
                earning an Associate’s Degree at my local community college, I discovered my passion for computer
                science. Now, with a Bachelor’s Degree, I’m excited to start my career in software engineering and
                make a meaningful impact.
