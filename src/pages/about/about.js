                First, thank you for taking the time to check out my website. i did this little project with react,
                javascript, and good old css. i am always looking for constructive feedback, so if you notice anything
                that could be improved or if there is a bug, let me know!

                i was introduced to computer gaming from an early age, which sparked it all.
                As i grew up playing video games, i started to tinker with the various components of my pc to
                gain more fps and maximize my computer's performance. i learned about overclocking my gpu,
                undervolting my cpu and even messing with the windows registry to remove unnecessary bloatware. one
                thing led to another, and eventually, i graduated high school with no idea what i wanted to do
                in life.. but what 18-year-old does yano?

                i then went to my local community college and worked on my associate's degree while taking various
                electives in an attempt to dial in on what i truly wanted. i landed on computer science and from there,
                the rest is history. i have now received my bachelor's degree and am looking to find my first
                professional software engineering role where i can make an impact by pursuing my passion.
