                My interest in computers started with gaming, which led me to tinker with my PC to boost performances.
                From overclocking my gpu to tweaking the Windows registry, i dove into the tech world early on. After
                earning an associate’s degree at my local community college, i discovered my passion for computer
                science. now, with a bachelor’s degree, i’m excited to start my career in software engineering and
                make a meaningful impact.
